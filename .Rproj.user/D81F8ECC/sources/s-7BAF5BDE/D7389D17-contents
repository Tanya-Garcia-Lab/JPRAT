Description: The Joint Progression of Risk Assessment Tool (JPRAT) evaluates and compares all outcomes simultaneously 
       across multiple studies and adjusts for outcome dependencies. The JPRAT is an estimation procedure that handles 
       multiple data hierarchy using an additive logistic mixed effect model. This algorithm handles censoring with pseudo-values and functional covariate effects with splines.
