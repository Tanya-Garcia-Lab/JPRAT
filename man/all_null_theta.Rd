\description{
This function constructs a list of all parameters and coefficients. The structure of each parameter or coefficient is a multi-dimensional array,
whose dimension size depends on the number of studies, the number of events, the number of covariates and the length of time points,etc.
This function also initializes all parameters and coefficients to zero arrays.
